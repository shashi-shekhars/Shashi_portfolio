# [Project 3 : Non invasive measurement of human physiological parameters](https://github.com/shashi-shekhars/Shashi_portfolio/tree/main/(ANN)%20Non-Invasive)

## Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to design a non-invasive method based device to monitor blood glucose measurement which is utilising the near-infrared region. There are some devices that are based on various non-invasive techniques but this project proposed a device based on artificial neural network for regression analysis to predict the blood glucose levels, which is absent from any other such device.

## Resources Used
• Softwares : MATLAB 2018a, NI Multisim
<br/>• Packages : NNTool, Artificial Neural Network
<br/>• Algorithm : Regression based Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm
