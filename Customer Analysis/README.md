# [Project 1 : Customer Analysis in Retail Business](https://github.com/shashi-shekhars/shashi_portfolio/tree/main/Customer%20Analysis)

# Project Overview
This project aims to support a retail or FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) company to formulate marketing and pricing strategies that could maximize revenues on each brand of a product. To reach the fullest potential of bringing up revenues, a company should find a good spot for price to maximize customer behaviours namely purchase probability, brand choice probability, and purchase quantity.

Data from customer purchase history were used for training the regression models to predict those three customer behaviours in a preconceived price range. The results were then converted into price elasticities so that we can examine the effects of changing price on each of the behaviours. Hence, they will be able to find the suitable marketing and pricing strategies.

To better position the products, we will firstly perform segmentation on our customers to support our analysis on customer behaviours, allowing us to customize marketing strategies for customers with different backgrounds.
